Number System Convertor
📘 Project Overview

A C-based console application that performs number system conversions between Decimal, Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal systems.

Designed to help understand data representation and base conversion algorithms used in low-level and embedded systems.

Built as part of Emerxe Information Technology’s Embedded Systems training.

⚙️ Features

✅ Convert Decimal → Binary, Decimal → Octal, and Decimal → Hexadecimal

✅ Convert Binary → Decimal, Octal → Decimal, and Hexadecimal → Binary

✅ Menu-driven interface for user-friendly interaction

✅ Input validation and modular code structure

✅ Works seamlessly on Linux GCC compiler
